GitHub has become a problematic monoculture. Its for-profit tool Copilot has been trained on public repositories, violating many software licenses, and both GitHub and its parent company Microsoft have historically repeatedly attacked copyleft licensing.

Any FOSS project should consider publishing their source code on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org), a democratic community-driven, non-profit software development platform.
